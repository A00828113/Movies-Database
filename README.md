# Movies-Database

This project uses the contents of an IMBD Database that has general relevant information about films. In here I use distinct graphs and visualizations to find answers to several questions
like: What is the most popular genre among the movies? Which are the movies that have historically generated the most income?
How has the production of movies changed throughout the years? And some other facts that can be found in the analysis.
